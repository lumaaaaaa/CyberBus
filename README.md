# CyberBus
Whether you're just lazy, or you simply don't appreciate the joy of driving a bus in the desert for hours, I have just the thing for you. CyberBus.

CyberBus is a bot that plays Desert Bus using the power of OCR. Now with 100% more Autopilot.

Precompiled binaries can be found at http://luma.pw/

This will probably only work on the Kega Fusion emulator due to very tiny color differences. Attempts with Gens v2.14 have failed and required new color values to be found.

# How It Works
Every .5 seconds, the program takes a screenshot. From this, it checks a single pixel values color to determine whether or not to steer left. Acceleration is automatic.

# Requirements to Run
- Computer that can run the Kega Fusion Emulator
- Kega Fusion Emulator (also Sega CD Bios files)
- Penn and Teller's Smoke and Mirrors Disc 1 (Desert Bus ROM)
- JRE installed
- Brain

# Usage
I recommend following these instructions if you want it to work properly.

1. Launch Kega Fusion, map left to Q and the virtual A button to the E key. Load the ROM ```Penn And Teller's Smoke and Mirrors Disc 1```
2. After done, press OK.
3. Select ```Desert Bus``` from the menu.
4. The bot will automatically start driving when the game is placed in fullscreen by pressing ESC in Kega Fusion.
5. Sit back and let your new Tesla CyberBus take you to Las Vegas!
 
# Enjoy
I hope that you all enjoy this program, it took me quite a bit of time to make, so some feedback would be appreciated!
